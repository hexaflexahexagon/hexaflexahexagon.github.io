# I Made a blog

This is my blog, I like to be wordy and write things. Usually about computer networking and all of the things associated with that. It's currently very new but I'll be both adding new posts and updating the site as time goes on.

## Link

Find the website at https://hexaflexahexagon.github.io

## Local hosting

Host locally using the included script:
```
./server.sh start # Start the server if not running
./server.sh stop # Stop the server if running
./server.sh restart # Restart the server regardless of if it is running
```
